## Implementations of Stochastic Processes

[Link to notebook](Stoch_Fall2022_PHW1/visualization.ipynb)

This notebook includes implementation of code that generate data samples
according to following processes:

- Gaussian Process
- Poisson Process
- Hawkess Process


## Markov Chain

### Part 1

[Link to notebook](Project/Markov-Chain/hmm-final-part1.ipynb)

"Baum-Welch" algorithm is implemented to train a Hidden Markov Model parameters from
sequences of observed data.

### Part 2

[Link to notebook](Project/Markov-Chain/hmm-final-part2.ipynb)

Hidden Markov Model parameters is trained using counting from sequence of observed
data and states.
"Viterbi" algorithm is implemented to find the most probable sequence of states from
observations

## Gibbs Sampling

[Link to notebook](Project/Gibbs-Sampling/gibbs.ipynb)

Implemented Gibbs sampling to denoise an image.
